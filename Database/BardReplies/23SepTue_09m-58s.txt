Q: top 3 best hacking movies?
A: Sure, here are my top 3 picks for the best hacking movies:

1. **The Matrix (1999)**. This iconic movie is a must-watch for any fan of science fiction or action movies. It tells the story of Neo, a computer hacker who learns that the world he lives in is actually a computer simulation. The movie's depiction of hacking is still relevant today, and it's also a visually stunning film.

The movie is full of memorable characters and quotable lines, and it's also a surprisingly accurate depiction of hacking at the time.

3. **Who Am I (2014)**. This German thriller is a more serious take on the hacking genre. It tells the story of a young hacker who becomes involved in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse with the government. The movie is well-acted and suspenseful, and it offers a thought-provoking look at the dark side of hacking.
